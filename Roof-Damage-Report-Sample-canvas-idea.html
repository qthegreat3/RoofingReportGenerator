	  Dear Veronica Woodyard,
	</div>
	<br/>
	<div>
	  At your request, First Coast Claims, LLC, conducted a limited, visual,
	nondestructive, structural assessment at your residence. This assessment
	was performed on 03/10/2014 by a representative of First Coast Claims. The
	purpose of this investigation was to observe damage that was reported at the
	residence and to determine the cause and extent of the reported damage. This
	report provides a summary of the findings, observations, and recommendations of
	the reported damage for the residence referenced above.
	</div>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<div>
	  <span class="title-header">General Observations</span>
	  <ul>
		<li>According to the County Property Appraiser, the home was built in 1997.
	The home appears to be in above average condition and well maintained</li>
			<li>The structure is a one story, single family dwelling</li>
		<li>The property is approximately 3810 total square feet. 2924 Heated square
	feet.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<div>
	  <span class="title-header">Roof Observations</span>
	  <ul>
		<li>The roof experienced a significant hail event. The observed distress to the
	above mentioned roof surface was a result of hail impacts and caused a
	reduction in the anticipated functional life of the roof surface.</li>
			<li>The roof surface is comprised of a 30 year Laminated shingle. The roof is a
	hip and gable style roof and has a 5/12 pitch. Various plumbing vents and
	off ridge style vents penetrate the roof envelope.</li>
		<li>The pattern, location, lack of crushed granules and varying size of the hail
	impacts are consistent with damage caused by the reported hail event on
	01/21/2014 and not mechanical or caused by a hammer as stated in the
	report from William John Associates.</li>
		<li>There is also damage to the chimney cap metal and downspouts which is
	consistent with hail and not hammer strikes.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<div>
	  <span class="title-header">Test Survey</span>
	  <ul>
		<li>Gold Star has performed four test surveys on the roof surface to quantify the
	extent of potential hail impact damage. The tests consisted of four randomly
	located areas on various slopes throughout the roof surface, noting the
	different types of damage on each of the shingles within the test area to
	determine the quantity and potential cause of damage to the roof shingles.</li>
		<li>There were approximately 70 roof shingles within each 10 foot x 10 foot
	measured on the slope test area. The results of the tests are as follows:
		  <ul>
		  <li>TS-1 Front facing slope (E) - 4 hail strikes located within the test square area.</li>
		  <li>TS-2 Rear slope (G) – 17 hail strikes located within the test square area.</li>
		  <li>TS-3 Left slope (H) – 12 hail strikes located within the test square area.</li>
		  <li>TS-4 Right (F) – 12 hail strikes located within the test square area.</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
		<li>After closely inspecting all the impact marks on the roof it is my
	professional opinion that the damage was not caused by a hammer but
	indeed caused by hail. None of the impact marks have crushed granules
	imbedded in the impact mark.</li>
		<li>When a shingle is struck or hit with a hammer it crushes the granules and
	leaves either a definitive circular or semi-circular mark or a “Frowny Face
	mark “ None of the impact strikes are the same size or shape. The strikes
	range from as small as 1⁄4 of an inch to 1 inch in size.</li>
		<li>If the damage was caused by a hammer all
	of the strikes would be the same size and shape. The different size strikes
	throughout the roofs surface are consistent with the reported size hail in that
	area.</li>
	  </ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<div>
	  <span class="title-header">Comments:</span>
	  <br/>
	  The following comments are based on observations made at the time of our
	inspection and based on a reasonable degree of professional certainty.
	  <ul>
		<li>The roof surface sustained significant hail damage as a result of the hail
	storm on 01/21/2014.</li>
		<li>There are 2 downspouts on the left side of the home that have dents in
	the metal on the same side of the roof where the hail is more dominate.</li>
		<li>After inspecting the 4 test squares on each slope I further inspected the
	remainder of the roofs surface to see if there would be hail strikes
	throughout the rest of the roof slopes and there was. Usually when
	damage is mechanically done to make it look like another cause of
	damage it is only in certain areas and not through the entire surface.</li>
		<li>The ability to repair the damages to the roof correctly is not possible due to
	the number of shingles damaged from this hail event and the condition of the
	shingles.</li>
		<li>Shingles were damaged on several slopes of the roof and the slopes that
	appear to have more damage than the other slopes is consistent with the
	direction of the storm.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	<div>
	  <span class="title-header">Recommendations</span>
	  <ul>
		<li>Due to the amount of shingles damaged from this hail event, the entire roof
	needs to be replaced. Repairs are not possible due to the amount of damage
	in each test square and condition of the shingles.</li>
		<li>As a result, attempting to repair this roof would require more than 25 percent
	of the roof surface to be replaced.</li>
		<li>Under section 611.11 of the Florida Building Code : “Not more than 25
	percent of the total roof area or roof section of an existing building or
	structure shall be repaired, replaced, or recovered in any 12 month
	period unless the entire roofing system or section is replaced.”</li>
	  </ul>
